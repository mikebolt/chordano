This is a work in progress. It is called "Chordano" because I plan to add support for playing arbitrary chords with each controller.

This project has only been tested with the HTC Vive.

## TODO

- Highlight keys when a controller is near them

- Use a synthesizer that sounds nicer

- Release keys when the trigger is released

- Adjust axis of rotation for keys

- Handle missing controllers better

- Allow display mirroring

- Add a chord programmer and a chord selector

- MIDI support?
